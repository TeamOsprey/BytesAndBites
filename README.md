#About Us

Welcome to Bytes and Bites, a fun and collaborative lunch-and-learn community for software enthusiasts, designers, and developers! We’re all about combining two great things—good food and great ideas—to explore the art and science of software design.

Each session, we dive into key topics like user experience (UX), interface design, system architecture, and problem-solving techniques, all while enjoying a casual and interactive environment. Whether you're a coding wizard, a design enthusiast, or just curious about building better software, there's a seat for you at our table.

So, grab your lunch, bring your appetite for knowledge, and let’s design the future together—one byte at a time!
