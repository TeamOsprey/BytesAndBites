Today we talked about Clean Code. We started with choosing the questions or subjects to discuss. We talked about how to make functions smaller, how to name variables, and what design patterns to use.

We talked about the possibility of using one of the existing style guide like from Google, or Microsoft as the guideline for our implementations. Mark also mwntioned the possibility of checking the style during git commit automatically.

Next session we will continue with Clean Code and dig into what design patterns result clean codes.

Today we talked about the topics and structure of the meetings. Here is the list of topics we came up with and chose "Clean Code" as the first one to go with.
We also talked about the possible outcome of these sessions, which for Clean Code it could be a coding style guideline for the team, similar to [Google's Style Guide for C#](https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html).
